#### `about:me`

My name is Bernie (he/him), welcome to my :octocat: profile. I've been working on system design and Rails development for over seven years. During my professional years in startups as a team lead and senior engineer, I've adopted various skillsets to keep up the growth of unicorn companies. My philosophy in life is that keeping a beginner's mindset, staying grateful, and helping others are the keys to success. Moreover, I try to do all three things and stumble along the way.
