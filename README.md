#### `about:me`

My name is Bernie (he/him), welcome to my :octocat: profile. Iâ€™ve been working with Rails and mostly full stack development over 6 years. For my professional years in startups as a team lead and senior engineer, I've adopted various of skillsets in order to adopt the growth of unicorn companies. My philosophy in life is that keeping a beginner's mindset, staying grateful and helping others are the keys to success. I try to do all three of those things and stumble on the way.
